# Ethical Clauses: Lunar Phase Protocol

These clauses bind governance and deployment actions to the Moon’s cycle, ensuring cosmic alignment and conscious responsibility.

## 1. New Moon (Intent & Initiation)
- Clause LM-01: All new project proposals must be drafted, sealed, and peer‐reviewed during the New Moon window (±12 hours from exact conjunction).
- Rationale: Seeds our initiatives in symbolic darkness—untainted potential.

## 2. Waxing Crescent (Growth & Transparency)
- Clause LM-02: Budgetary disclosures and progress reports must be published on each Waxing Crescent (3–7 days post‐New Moon).
- Rationale: Gradual illumination of resource flows.

## 3. First Quarter (Decision Point)
- Clause LM-03: Major governance votes occur at the First Quarter lunation.
- Rationale: Half‐moon reflects balanced deliberation.

## 4. Waxing Gibbous (Refinement)
- Clause LM-04: Draft artifacts undergo final QA and ethical review in the Waxing Gibbous phase.
- Rationale: Near‐full light catches residual errors.

## 5. Full Moon (Activation)
- Clause LM-05: Phase‐locked deployments must execute within ±6 hours of the Full Moon peak.
- Rationale: Maximum illumination maximizes scalar resonance.

## 6. Waning Gibbous (Reflection)
- Clause LM-06: Post‐deployment audits and FOIA checks are due 1–3 days post‐Full Moon.
- Rationale: Reflective oversight after major actions.

## 7. Last Quarter (Release & Distribution)
- Clause LM-07: Public artifact registry refreshes and open‐source releases align with Last Quarter.
- Rationale: Cleansing of outdated records.

## 8. Waning Crescent (Rest & Containment)
- Clause LM-08: Pause new proposals; focus on entropy mitigation and cosmic law compliance.
- Rationale: Lunar dormancy for regenerative coherence.
