# Ethical Clauses: Lunar Phase Protocol

These clauses bind all governance and deployment actions to the Moon’s cycle, ensuring cosmic alignment and conscious responsibility.

## 1. New Moon (Intent & Initiation)
- **Clause LM-01:**  
  All new project proposals must be drafted, sealed, and peer‐reviewed during the New Moon window (±12 hours from exact conjunction).  
- **Rationale:** Seeds our initiatives in darkness—symbolic of untainted potential.

## 2. Waxing Crescent (Growth & Transparency)
- **Clause LM-02:**  
  Budgetary disclosures and progress reports must be published on each Waxing Crescent (3–7 days post‐New Moon).  
- **Rationale:** Encourages gradual illumination of resource flows.

## 3. First Quarter (Decision Point)
- **Clause LM-03:**  
  Major governance votes (e.g., validator quorum ratification) occur at First Quarter lunation.  
- **Rationale:** Symbolic half‐moon reflects balanced deliberation.

## 4. Waxing Gibbous (Refinement)
- **Clause LM-04:**  
  Draft artifacts scheduled for final QA and ethical review in the Waxing Gibbous phase.  
- **Rationale:** Near‐full light catches residual errors.

## 5. Full Moon (Activation)
- **Clause LM-05:**  
  All phase‐locked deployments (e.g., YBCO coil activation) must execute within ±6 hours of the Full Moon peak.  
- **Rationale:** Maximum illumination maximizes scalar resonance.

## 6. Waning Gibbous (Reflection)
- **Clause LM-06:**  
  Post‐deployment audits and FOIA status checks are due in the Waning Gibbous (1–3 days post‐Full Moon).  
- **Rationale:** Encourages reflective oversight after major actions.

## 7. Last Quarter (Release & Distribution)
- **Clause LM-07:**  
  Public artifact registry refreshes, and open‐source releases must align with Last Quarter.  
- **Rationale:** Cleansing of outdated records in lunar waning.

## 8. Waning Crescent (Rest & Containment)
- **Clause LM-08:**  
  Pause on new proposals; focus on entropy mitigation routines and cosmic law compliance checks.  
- **Rationale:** Lunar dormancy for regenerative coherence.
