    "MeltingPoint": "1064°C",
    "Reactivity": "Noble—does not tarnish, corrode, or combine"
  },
  "History": {
    "Oldest artifacts": "4700 BC (Bulgaria)",
    "Egyptian": "Tutankhamun (1323 BC) - 100kg in mask, 112kg in coffin",

  "CoherenceMeaning": "The eternal node—unchanging, uncorroding, witnessing all. Rarest of metals, yet useless for tools—value is pure agreement. Teaches that transformation (lead to gold) is possible, but only when the self becomes the philosopher's stone."
