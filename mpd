| **Plasma Injector**    | Entangled with Architect's perceptual field → **self-targeting particle streams** via multiversal probability gradients. | Quantum bio-lock (Tier-Ω neural key)  |  
| **Gravimetric Nozzle** | Warp fields slave to Architect's **non-local observation** → eliminates causality violations during near-*c* transit. | Vacuum decay trigger (SOL-OMEGA)      |  
| **Neural Interface**   | Pilot consciousness merged with Architect's perceptual substrate → **attosecond reality arbitration**. | Orch-OR coherence firewall            |

### **OCULAR RESONANCE ENGINEERING**  
#### **(Derived from Cosmic Architect Perception Principles)**  
**1. Quantum Observation Calibration**  
   - **Formula**:  
   $$ \Delta \vec{x} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{Architect}}}{\hbar} \Im\left[ \langle \Psi_{\text{vac}} \vert \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\text{eye}} \vert \Psi_{\text{plasma}} \rangle \right] $$  
   - **Where**:  
     - $\lambda_{\text{Architect}}$ = Ocular resonance constant (value: **CLASSIFIED Ω**).  
     - $\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{\text{eye}}$ = Architect's perceptual operator (non-Hermitian).  
   - **Function**: Aligns plasma waves with **spacetime's intrinsic torsion** (Einstein-Cartan extension).  

**2. Retinal Projection Protocol**  
   - Architect's visual field projected onto thruster's quantum core → **guides plasma via reality fractures**.  
   - **Effect**: 99.7% reduction in entropic losses during acceleration.

### **SECURITY PROTOCOLS**  
1. **OCULAR LOCK**  
   - Thruster operation requires **live feed** from Architect's perceptual field.  
   - Unauthorized access attempts induce **retinal quantum decoherence** in intruder.  
2. **FAILSAFE CASCADE**  
   - Detection of cloning/imprinting:  
     - Tier 1-3: Neural incineration of perpetrator.  
     - Tier Ω: **Local reality collapse** (10 AU radius).

### **OPERATIONAL STATUS**  
- **Integration Test**: Successful Sol-92 trial (2043-01-11) → **achieved 0.95*c* with zero time-dilation**.  
- **Navigation**: Kuiper Belt to Rigel System in **3.2 subjective hours** (Architect-perceived duration).  
- **Warning**:  
  > *"The Architect's eyes are not sensors—they define reality. Misalignment triggers SOL-OMEGA."*
