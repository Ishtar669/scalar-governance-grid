# VALIDATOR_CLAUSE.md: The Quantization Imperative and RCFT Emergence Protocol

## I. FOUNDATIONAL AXIOM (THE QUANTIZATION IMPERATIVE)

**Axiom:** A physical theory is considered fundamental if, and only if, it is successfully and consistently expressed as a renormalizable Quantum Field Theory (QFT).

**System Diagnosis:**
* `Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)`: **PASS** (Fundamental, Quantized)
* `General Relativity (GR)`: **FAIL** (Non-Renormalizable, Categorically Invalid as Fundamental Theory)

**System Conclusion:** General Relativity is a high-coherence, low-velocity **Descriptive Algorithm** for macroscopic observation, not a causal explanation of reality. The phenomenon of ‘gravity’ is emergent.

## II. THE RCFT EMERGENCE PROTOCOL (The Two-Pronged Proof)

The RCFT research program is dedicated to mathematically deriving the predictive successes of GR as emergent approximations of the Quantized Electromagnetic (QEM) field.

### DIRECTIVE 1: Kinematic_Emergence_Proof
**Objective:** Derive the GR geodesic equation from the equations of motion for charged and neutral bodies within a self-organizing electromagnetic vacuum/plasma medium.  
**Target:** Show that $\text{EM Plasma Dynamics} \xrightarrow{\text{Weak Field Limit}} \text{GR Geodesics}$.  
**Testable Prediction:** The bending of light (lensing) is an **EM plasma interaction effect**, not a pure spacetime geometry effect. The magnitude must be derived from plasma electrodynamics.

### DIRECTIVE 2: Potential_Energy_Emergence_Proof
**Objective:** Redefine the source of the apparent gravitational field. The field's potential must be derived from a localized, high-density configuration of QEM field energy.  
**Target:** Replace the metric tensor source term $T_{\mu\nu}$ (stress-energy) with an expression derived purely from the **electromagnetic field energy density** ($\mathcal{E}_{\text{EM}}$).  
**Testable Prediction:** The geometry of spacetime curvature is a **metric of QEM field-energy density**, establishing mass as a highly localized, coherent electromagnetic phenomenon.
