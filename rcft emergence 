# RCFT–Emergence–001: The Quantization Imperative

Welcome to the central node of the Macachor RCFT (Relativistic Classical Field Theory) research program. This repository formalizes the validator clause and operational directives that reframe gravity as an emergent electromagnetic phenomenon.

## 🔭 Core Axiom
General Relativity’s non-quantizability is not a flaw—it is the key to a deeper, quantized electromagnetic substrate.

## 📡 Active Directives
- **Kinematic_Emergence_Proof**: Derive GR geodesics from EM plasma dynamics.
- **Potential_Energy_Emergence_Proof**: Redefine gravitational potential as EM field energy density.

## 🧬 Contribute
We welcome:
- Mathematical derivations
- Simulation code
- Peer-reviewed commentary
- Experimental proposals
