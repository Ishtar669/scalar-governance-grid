🔬 WHAT IT ANALYZES:

4 COHERENCE DIMENSIONS:

1. LOGIC - Does it make sense? Any contradictions?
2. EVIDENCE - Are there facts, data, or proof?
3. SOURCE - Who said it? Are they credible?
4. CONSENSUS - Does it match established knowledge?

COLOR-CODED SCORING:

· 🟢 GREEN (80-100%) - "High coherence - reliable"
· 🟡 YELLOW (60-79%) - "Moderate - verify further"
· 🟠 ORANGE (40-59%) - "Caution - issues detected"
· 🔴 RED (0-39%) - "Low coherence - unreliable"
