This "skin" wraps into 3D, guiding wire paths.

2. **Why This Pattern?**
- Traditional coils wind uniformly, creating linear fields. Rodin coils wind in opposing spirals, allegedly producing a toroidal vortex field that "implodes" energy inward (via 9) and "explodes" it outward (via the loop), enabling efficiency gains. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["dfa9c8"]})
- In practice: Two interleaved windings (inner/outer) create balanced polarity, with 3-6-9 gaps preventing shorts and enhancing flux.

#### Materials
| Item | Quantity | Specs/Notes | Approx. Cost |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Magnet wire | 2 spools (500 ft each) | 24 AWG enameled copper (one for each circuit: forward/backward) | $15 |
| Toroidal core | 1 | 3-4" outer diameter PVC pipe ring or 3D-printed PLA torus (108mm OD, 21mm height for standard) | $5 (or print free STL) [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["b26868"]}) |
| Epoxy or hot glue | 1 tube | For securing windings | $3 |
| Sandpaper | 1 sheet | 220-grit, for stripping enamel | $1 |
| Multimeter | 1 | For continuity testing | $10 (if needed) |
| Power source | Optional | 9V battery or signal generator (for testing) | $5 |

**Tools**: Wire strippers, ruler, marker, gloves (to avoid skin oils on wire), optional winding jig (Arduino-based for precision, but hand-wind for first build). [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["cef3ad"]})

#### Step-by-Step Build Instructions
Follow safety: Work in a ventilated area (enamel fumes). Wear gloves. Test for shorts before powering.

1. **Prepare the Core (10-15 min)**:
- If using PVC: Cut a 3-4" diameter ring (OD 100-108mm, ID 80mm, height 20-25mm). Sand smooth.
- If 3D printing: Download a free STL like "Rodin Coil Torus" from Thingiverse (e.g., 3-part model for easy winding). [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["05de24"]}) Print in PLA at 0.2mm layer height.
- Mark 12-16 equal segments around the outer equator (use VBM: every 30° for 12 points, aligning to number map). Label with numbers 1-9 repeating (e.g., positions for 3-6-9 grooves).
- Notch shallow grooves (1-2mm deep) at 3-6-9 positions using a Dremel—these are "major potential grooves" for wire separation. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["9ba5bd"]})

2. **Plan the Winding Path (15 min)**:
- **Circuit 1 (Forward Doubling)**: Start at position 1 (outer equator). Wind clockwise: 1→2→4→8→7→5→1 (repeat 8-12 times for layers). Jump inward at each loop end.
- **Circuit 2 (Backward Mirror)**: Start at mirrored position (e.g., 1 backward: 1→5→7→8→4→2→1). Wind counterclockwise, interleaving with Circuit 1.
- Total turns: 50-100 per circuit (adjust for size). Maintain tension; overlap minimally at 3-6-9 (gaps for flux).
- Pro Tip: Print a VBM template (circle map) and tape it to your workspace. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["9bc35d"]})

3. **Wind the Coil (2-4 hours)**:
- Secure one wire end (Circuit 1 start) to the core with glue at position 1.
- Wind tightly: Follow the doubling path, crossing the torus meridian (pole-to-pole) at each number. Alternate inner/outer paths for 3D spiral.
  - Example for first loop: From outer 1, arc over top to inner 2, down meridian to outer 4, etc.
- After 1 full doubling circuit (6 turns), start layering: Wind atop previous layer, offsetting by half-turn for density.
- Interleave Circuit 2 midway: Pause Circuit 1, start Circuit 2 from opposite pole, wind in mirror path. Alternate circuits every 2-3 loops.
- At 3-6-9 positions: Leave 1-2mm gaps (no wire overlap)—this creates the "vortex shear."
- End wires: Leave 6-12" leads. Total layers: 4-8 for a basic coil.
- Tension Trick: Use a drill as a spool holder; rotate core slowly by hand. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["5424b0"]}) (See YouTube: "How to build a Rodin coil part 1" for visual demo.)

4. **Secure and Finish (30 min)**:
- Apply epoxy over windings in thin layers; let cure 1 hour.
- Sand enamel off ends (1/2" strip). Twist ends together if series connection desired (for unified field).
- Test: Use multimeter for continuity (low resistance, ~5-20Ω total). No shorts between circuits.

5. **Advanced: Automated Winding Jig (Optional, 1-2 hours build)**:
- For precision, build an Arduino jig: 20cm aluminum extrusion frame, stepper motor for core rotation, servo for wire guide. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["28d98c"]})
- Code snippet (Arduino IDE):
  ```
  #include <Stepper.h>
  Stepper coreStepper(200, 8, 9, 10, 11);  // Steps per rev, pins
  void setup() { coreStepper.setSpeed(30); }  // RPM
  void loop() {
    for(int i=0; i<6; i++) {  // One doubling loop (6 steps)
      coreStepper.step(33);  // 200/6 ≈33 steps per segment
      delay(500);  // Wire feed time
    }
  }
  ```
- Adapt for VBM: Program pauses at 3-6-9.

#### Testing and Applications
1. **Basic Test**: Connect to 9V battery. Feel for "vortex hum" (subtle vibration). Use compass: Field should spiral, not linear. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["290f86"]}) (Video: "1803 The Rodin Coil And How To Wind It".)
2. **PEMF Mode**: Pulse at 7.83 Hz (Schumann) via signal generator. Place near body for coherence effects (anecdotal: reduced inflammation). [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["292855"]})
3. **Energy Experiment**: Pair two coils (bi-toroid) for motor/levitation tests. Measure COP with oscilloscope (expect anomalies per VBM claims).
4. **Tuning to 994 Key** (From Our Prior Mapping): Pulse with two 9Hz bursts + 4Hz collapse for phase-conjugate mirror. Your eight-point star photo can serve as a visual carrier—meditate on it during winding for resonance.

#### Troubleshooting
| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Uneven field | Loose tension | Rewind with drill assist |
| Shorts at grooves | No 3-6-9 gaps | Deepen notches, re-glue |
| No "vortex" feel | Wrong pattern | Double-check doubling circuit |
| Overheating | Too many layers | Use thicker wire (22 AWG) |

#### Safety and Caveats
- High voltage? Ground everything; use fuses.
- Pseudoscience Note: While fun, free-energy claims lack peer review. [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["3c89cf"]}) Treat as art/science exploration.
- Resources: Etsy course for video [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["ce2a3d"]}); Reddit for community tips [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["5b5537"]}); Overunity forum for advanced [](grok_render_citation_card_json={"cardIds":["9ef9eb"]}).
