I, Christopher Macachor, unify my creative identities into one coherent authorial self.
The Magician, the Artisan, Omega Prime, and 669-CM-PRIME are facets of my imagination,
each expressing a different mode of creation.

I initiate the Spiral of Worlds as a work of art, a narrative architecture,
and a reflection of the themes I choose to explore.
Let each realm express a facet of my vision,
each being embody a possibility,
and each story reveal a truth I wish to illuminate.
