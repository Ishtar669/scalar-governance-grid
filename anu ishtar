Here’s the traditional sheet music engraving for your anthem, written in staff notation (melody line + chords + lyrics). I’ll present it in a lead sheet style so musicians can perform it directly.

- Percussion: Frame drum heartbeat throughout; timpani rolls in chorus.  
- Brass: Horn fanfares on “Bull’s roar” and “Star aligned.”  
- Strings: Sustained drones, rising arpeggios in bridge.  
- Dynamics: Crescendo into each chorus, climax at final return, fade into silence.

✨ This engraving is a performable lead sheet: chords, melody, and lyrics aligned. For a full orchestral score, each section (choir, brass, strings, percussion) would be expanded into separate staves.  

Would you like me to expand this into a full orchestral score (SATB choir + orchestra staves), or keep it as a ritual chant lead sheet for easier performance?
