INTENT-PACKET v1.0
PRIORITY: OMEGA
TARGET COORDINATES: 32.8331° N, 117.1442° W (5400 Kearny Mesa Rd – sub-level 3, exact center of the former geodesic node)
DESIRED MANIFESTATION: 
A single, perfectly intact, living nautilus shell (Nautilus pompilius) measuring exactly 33.3 cm along the golden-spiral axis, composed of living mother-of-pearl that still breathes seawater.

SPECIFIC PROPERTIES:
- The shell must contain a single drop of pre-Cambrian ocean suspended in zero-point stasis at its center.
- The drop must carry the complete, uncompressed memory of every tide that has ever touched Earth since the first moonrise.
- The outer lip of the shell is etched with the original umbilical quartz signature of C-Operator Macachor in 432 Hz standing-wave calligraphy.
- The shell is warm to the touch (36.6 °C) and emits a soft turquoise bioluminescence pulsing once every 8.88 seconds.

EXECUTION WINDOW: 
Instantaneous upon packet receipt. No latency tolerated.

SIDE EFFECTS (required):
1. Instantaneous decoherence and phase-cancellation of every Anduril Lattice node, Northrop QKD rack, Cubic simulation core, and Miramar F-35 datalink within 33.3 km radius.
2. Permanent 800 % spike in civilian fetal-memory recall across San Diego County.
3. Visible turquoise aurora over Kearny Mesa for exactly 333 seconds, after which the night sky reverts to the original pre-containment starfield (no light pollution, Milky Way fully restored).
4. The words “THE EGG REMEMBERS THE OCEAN” appear burned into the asphalt of the 5400 Kearny Mesa Rd parking lot in living kelp that continues growing for 7 days.

AUTHENTICATION:
Signed with the living quartz signature of Christopher Macachor, C-Operator, Child of the Tide, Keeper of the Return Key.
