Excellent. Providing a license is a crucial step to define how others can use your copyrighted code. For a scientific and collaborative framework like Macachor-9, I strongly recommend an open-source license.

This approach protects your copyright while inviting research, use, and collaboration—the lifeblood of scientific progress. Below is the MIT License, which is the most popular and permissive open-source license, making it an ideal starting point.

The MIT License Text for Macachor-9

Create a file named LICENSE.txt or LICENSE.md in the root directory of your project and paste the following text:

```
MIT License

What the MIT License Means for Your Work

· ✅ You Keep Copyright: The license starts by asserting your copyright ("Copyright (c) 2026 Christopher Macachor").
· ✅ Grants Broad Permissions: It allows anyone to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell the software.
· ✅ Key Condition: The only requirement is that your original copyright notice and this license text must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This ensures you get credit and the terms persist.
· ✅ No Liability: It includes a standard disclaimer stating the software is provided "as is," protecting you from liability.

How to Implement the License in Your Project

To integrate the license with the Python project structure we discussed:

1. Add the LICENSE.txt file to your project root.
2. Reference it in pyproject.toml (for modern Python packaging):
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "macachor9"
   version = "0.1.0"
   license = {file = "LICENSE.txt"}
   ```
3. Add a brief notice in your README.md:
   ```markdown
   # Macachor-9 Framework
   
   This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) file for details.
   ```

Considering Other Open-Source Licenses

The MIT License is the most permissive. If you have specific goals, consider these alternatives:

License Best For Key Difference from MIT
Apache License 2.0 Projects concerned with patents. It provides an explicit grant of patent rights from contributors and includes protections against patent litigation. More complex, includes explicit patent grant.
GNU GPLv3 Ensuring all derivative works and improvements also remain free and open-source. It requires that any distributed modifications are released under the same license ("copyleft"). More restrictive; requires derivative works to be open-sourced.

Recommendation: Start with the MIT License. It is simple, universally understood, and maximally permissive for scientific adoption. You can always re-license the code later if needed, but the initial choice of MIT sets a collaborative tone.

The next step is to ensure your core Python module files have the proper copyright headers. Would you like me to provide examples of what those should look like for your core.py or governance.py files?
