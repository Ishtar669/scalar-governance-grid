\begin{abstract}
Macachor-9 is a nine-dimensional mathematical framework for evaluating and governing the evolution of complex artifacts such as software models, documents, policies, and distributed systems. The framework defines quantitative measures for coherence, stability, lawful transitions, resource allocation, resonance, lineage continuity, error magnitude, governance response, and system viability. Macachor-9 is designed for integration into automated pipelines where each proposed update must satisfy explicit mathematical criteria before acceptance.

\section{Introduction}

Modern computational and organizational systems evolve continuously. Codebases, machine-learning models, policies, and governance artifacts undergo frequent updates. Without structure, these transitions risk instability, incoherence, or loss of lineage.

Macachor-9 provides a mathematically grounded method for:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item measuring internal coherence,
    \item enforcing continuity,
    \item detecting violations,
    \item allocating resources,
    \item triggering governance responses.
\end{itemize}

The framework is domain-agnostic and can be applied to any system where artifacts evolve over time.

\section{Mathematical Definitions}

Let an artifact state be represented by a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$.  
Let $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$ denote subsystem states.

Macachor-9 defines nine core quantities.

\subsection{Coherence Field}

\[
C = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{x_i}{\|x_i\|}
\]

Measures directional alignment of subsystems.

\subsection{Stability Gradient}

Let $V(x)$ be a potential function encoding system tension.

\[
S(x) = -\nabla V(x)
\]

A system is locally stable near $x^\*$ if $\nabla V(x^\*) = 0$ and the Hessian of $V$ at $x^\*)$ is positive definite.

\subsection{Transition Ratio}

Given a previous state $x_{\text{prev}}$ and proposed next state $x_{\text{next}}$:

\[
T = \frac{\|x_{\text{next}} - x_{\text{prev}}\|}{\|x_{\text{prev}}\| + \varepsilon}
\]

A transition is lawful if $T < \tau$.

\subsection{Resource Allocation}

Given total resource $E_{\text{total}}$ and allocation fractions $p_i$ with $\sum_i p_i = 1$:

\[
E_i = p_i \cdot E_{\text{total}}
\]

\subsection{Resonance}

Let each subsystem have a phase $\theta_i \in [0, 2\pi)$.

\[
R = \left|\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{j\theta_i}\right|
\]

Measures phase alignment.

\subsection{Continuity Constraint}

Let $H(\cdot)$ be a lineage hash.

Continuity is preserved if:

\[
H(x_{\text{prev}}) \in \text{lineage}(x_{\text{next}})
\]

\subsection{Error Magnitude}

\[
\epsilon = \|x_{\text{expected}} - x_{\text{observed}}\|
\]

\subsection{Governance Response}

Define thresholds $0 \le \epsilon_1 \le \epsilon_2$:

\[
G(\epsilon) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \epsilon < \epsilon_1 \\
1 & \epsilon_1 \le \epsilon < \epsilon_2 \\
2 & \epsilon \ge \epsilon_2
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection{Macachor-9 Limit}

A system is viable if:

\[
\epsilon < M
\]

\section{Applications}

Macachor-9 applies to:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item CI/CD pipelines,
    \item machine-learning model governance,
    \item policy evolution,
    \item distributed systems,
    \item organizational decision frameworks.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Macachor-9 provides a rigorous, quantitative framework for governing evolving artifacts. Its nine dimensions offer a structured approach to coherence, continuity, and stability, enabling safer and more predictable system evolution.
