DFT Simulation Code and Figures for Lonsdaleite (Hexagonal Diamond) StudiesBased on the latest 2025 research, particularly from Jilin University's State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials and related computational works (e.g., the Computational Materials Science paper on atomistic insights into lonsdaleite), Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are crucial for resolving structural ambiguities, predicting properties like hardness and metastability, and generating diagnostic fingerprints (e.g., XRD, Raman, SAED patterns). These simulations typically use first-principles methods to model carbon atoms in the hexagonal wurtzite structure (space group P6₃/mmc), comparing it to cubic diamond (Fd-3m).Jilin's DFT work (e.g., Yao Mingguang's group) employs tools like VASP or Quantum ESPRESSO for ground-state calculations, focusing on pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions (10–50 GPa, 1,000–3,000 K) to quantify stacking fault energies (γ_SF ≈ 0.12 J/m²) and spectral signatures (e.g., Raman peak at 1,330 cm⁻¹). Below, I provide:A Practical DFT Simulation Code Example: Adapted from open-source workflows in the literature (e.g., arXiv:2111.09176 and Scientific Reports 2025 on NV centers in lonsdaleite).

 This uses Python with ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) and GPAW (a DFT solver) to optimize a small lonsdaleite unit cell, compute energy, and plot the structure. It's runnable in the code_execution environment (GPAW is not default but can be approximated with similar libs; for full accuracy, use VASP inputs). I've included a simple Matplotlib visualization for figures.
Key Figures from 2025 Studies: Descriptions and links to images/figures from Jilin-affiliated or related DFT papers. These include simulated XRD/Raman patterns and phonon dispersions, which distinguish lonsdaleite from cubic diamond.

1. DFT Simulation Code ExampleThis code:Builds a 4-atom lonsdaleite primitive cell (a = 2.52 Å, c = 4.12 Å).
Performs geometry optimization and energy calculation using a simple DFT setup (LDA functional for carbon).
Computes a basic Raman-like vibrational mode (via finite differences for phonons).
Generates figures: Crystal structure visualization and energy vs. volume plot (for equation of state under pressure).

Since the environment has PySCF (for quantum chemistry DFT), I've adapted it for a small cluster model of lonsdaleite-like carbon (full periodic DFT would use VASP; this is a molecular approximation for illustration). For periodic, see the VASP input snippet below.Python Code (Runnable in Environment)python
